playing around with Processing Development Environment. creating digital art

thank you for taking the time and effort to view my code. i hope to create digital art using the Processing Development Environment which uses Java.
i first began coding using java in 2014, during my second year of high school.
it was my first language and i have come to love it, although the majority of the remainder of my coding has been in Python.
